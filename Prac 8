Modularizing the website is one of the main advantages of creating a custom WordPress theme. You may build a uniform layout across all pages by splitting the website's various components into modules, such as the header, footer, and sidebar. This makes it simple to make changes to the layout and functionality of the website because you only need to update the pertinent modules rather than each individual page.

The development of a unique WordPress theme requires a firm grasp of HTML, CSS, and PHP. For speeding up the development process, you can utilise pre-built frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation. There are also several WordPress-specific tools and resources, such as the WordPress Theme Handbook, that may assist in the creation of custom themes.

It's important to think about the user experience and make sure the design is both visually pleasing and functional while creating a custom WordPress theme. Make sure your theme is responsive, which enables it to adjust to various screen sizes and devices, and that it is performance- and speed-optimized.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights

From Linkedin Courses: Although I don't see myself pursuing WordPress themes outside of school, reading about code modularization and DRY practises was quite intriguing. This method may also be used for other web development projects and is not exclusive to WordPress. When changing or updating any website, time and effort can be saved by using modular code.

**From Learning Experiment:**This experiment showed me that regular exercise can definitely increase learning capacity and improve cognitive capacities. I was able to focus better, remember more information, and work more productively on the days that I exercised before studying. This experiment also made it clear to me that even tiny adjustments to my daily routine can have a significant impact on my capacity to absorb information. I may easily and effectively increase my learning capacity by including physical activity in my everyday routine. I had stopped working out in favour of spending more time throughout the week concentrating on my job and school, but this experiment encouraged me to start up again. Even 20 to 30 minutes of moderate exercise may improve my mood for the day, and when I look about it that way, I can see why it has a significant effect on my learning.
