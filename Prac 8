Learning Experiment

Theory: As I HEARD THAT MEDICATION HELPS ALOT IN IMPROVING WORK SKILLS AND EFFICEINCY, I REALLY THOUGHT i need that as I am facing mental stress from long which is pressure on me.
Test:- I thought of doing medication early in morning everyday for next following week and then check timing I take to do house hold chores and other things and then compare with timmings and efficiency I do without medication I will also perform self introvention. 

Estimated Hours

One of the key benefits of developing a unique WordPress theme is the ability to modularise the website. By dividing the website's major elements into modules, such as the header, footer, and sidebar, you may create a consistent layout throughout all pages. Because you just need to update the relevant modules rather than every single page, it is easy to change the design and functionality of the website.

A solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and PHP is necessary for the creation of a distinctive WordPress theme. You can use pre-built frameworks like Bootstrap or Foundation to hasten the development process. The development of custom themes can also benefit from a number of WordPress-specific tools and resources, such as the WordPress Theme Handbook.

It's crucial to When making a custom WordPress theme, bear in mind the user experience and guarantee that the design is both aesthetically beautiful and practical. Make sure your theme is performance- and speed-optimized, responsive, and able to adapt to a range of screen sizes and devices.

Learning, Employability, and Career Insights

Linkedin Courses, from: While reading about code modularization and DRY practises was fairly interesting, I don't see myself pursuing WordPress themes outside of school. This approach is not restricted to WordPress and may be utilised for other web development projects as well. Modular code can save time and effort when upgrading or updating any website.

Referring to the learning experiment:
This experiment convinced me that regular exercise can enhance cognitive abilities and increase learning capacity. On the days I exercised before studying, I was able to concentrate better, retain more knowledge, and produce more work. Through this experiment, I also realised that even the smallest changes to my daily routine can have a big impact on my ability to retain information. 
By incorporating physical activity into my daily routine, I may quickly and efficiently boost my capacity for learning. I had given up exercising to spend more time throughout the week focusing on my job and education, but this experiment inspired me to pick it back up. When I think about it that way, I can see why even 20 to 30 minutes of moderate activity may boost my mood for the day.
