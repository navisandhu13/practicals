Learning Activities/ Resources 
this practical we been asked to download and install Vagrant, virtual box and wordmove on the top 
I thought I have already completed during previous weeks
setting up local host that is XAMPP for me downloading joomla and wordpress on laptops and copying them to htdocs that is going to be root folder 
creating databases from phpadmin and installing joomla and wordpress one by one 
earlier so many errors came up but luckily all fixed with help of lecturer and online support now both websites working good locally 
successfully launched.

But I found out for this practical vagrant and workmove is must 

estimated time :-
5  hours this time including time of installation and downloading.

Content insights:- 
I browsed all features checked what i can do with localhost and how it is going to be benificial I found how usefull wordmove is Create and deploy websites using content management systems,including 
creating and editing content, creating custom templatesor themes, and performing site management Examine installation and maintenance considerations for modernwebsites Appraise different options

I never used vvv Vagrant before but found out that VVV is a local developer environment, mainly aimed at WordPress developers. It uses Vagrant and VirtualBox/Parallels/HyperV to create a
linux server environment for building sites, and contributing to WordPress itself.

As I am using macos I got binary options to download vargrant SoI downloaded AMD64. It installed successfully as well, but I started getting troubles in installing virtualbox it says cannot download virtual box
In bash I uninstalled Vagrant as my lecturer told me it might be because I downloaded vagrant before vitualbox, but still issue is same I was not even receiving any clue why I cannot install it it downloaded successfully 
but I cannot instal it, watched many videos some says something tried every way but still problem is still same not recovered at all.
