I never used vvv Vagrant before but found out that VVV is a local developer environment, mainly aimed at WordPress developers. It uses Vagrant and VirtualBox/Parallels/HyperV to create a
linux server environment for building sites, and contributing to WordPress itself.

As I am using macos I got binary options to download vargrant SoI downloaded AMD64. It installed successfully as well, but I started getting troubles in installing virtualbox it says cannot download virtual box
In bash I uninstalled Vagrant as my lecturer told me it might be because I downloaded vagrant before vitualbox, but still issue is same I was not even receiving any clue why I cannot install it it downloaded successfully 
but I cannot instal it, watched many videos some says something tried every way but still problem is still same not recovered at all.
