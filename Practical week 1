Learning Insights:- At first bootstrap is not working on my Mac OS and then I decided to write simple html code in my textedit 
but then I was getting errors that files was not saved as .html format they changing it to .rtf I started panicking then After watching video on youtube
I found out that I need to change my textedit preferences to plain text then I did that I found some different layout in textedit but tried saving my file again it started saving as .txt now 
I was so worried like how I can fix that
and this time my GitHub and learn jeu nothing was working on my
home computer I emailed to IT Helpdesk hopefully they fix that soon so that I can focus on my future practicals 
after getting and retreiving my github details I straightaway started writing my learning journal and what are things I learnt and went through 
In getting access to all of this, All I knew is that I need mamp to be installed so I started working on mamp and created just basic html code stating first page of my startup.
