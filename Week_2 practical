I started this practical in my class at first all students was given a list of options of localhost that we can install on our laptops 
but I found Xampp is more interactive and more useful I guess so it will be in future
I installed xampp successfully then started installing joomla but after successful instalation I copied all files under htdocs under folder names Joomla_4 then tried opeing it but I did not knew that localhost is case sensitive so I need to be very accurate with names 
and eveything. But after entring correct details as well I was not able to launch it 
I started receiving error 403 something like no access 
I showed it to my lectuer she checked and provided me with link from where I can follow steps to fix that error 
A actual error was fixed luckily now atleast my Joomla was launched but I received anoher erorr saying 
An error has occurred while processing your request.
0 Failed opening required '/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/Joomla_4/administrator/cache/autoload_psr4.php' (include_path='.:/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/lib/php')
I got so ancious that what is this happening with me I am trying my best but error coming up one by one and now Time had run out it was almost finish of our class
and I am unable to finish as some errors I was receiving while installing joomla on my pc. I thought I will give it a go at home. 

Now after watching step to step video on youtube i followed everystep thoroghly and found I did not created database with sme name and I did not changed permissions 
by going to settings and apply to all enclosed files of joomla folder and making all of them as read and write. 
After doing all these I refreshed my browser and hurray my Joomla was successfully launched with no erorr now screen came up with instalation I followed everything from that youtube video and installed joomla successfully. 

I started building my website on my own business theme Which I will be launching soon this year it will be a small business of selling goods and things related to designer dine in, or home theme
Name of this business is C.K. Closet Coture. 
At this moment atleast I know That I need to create a ecommerce website so figured everything out 
I started by editing template on Joomla started figuring out some features and editing features it provides 
I created three pages names team gallery about
