Learning activities and Resources :-
I missed class for todays lecture so missed with group interview section 
But  there is only 4 students this time from there i already know one with whom I studied previous subjects 2 were new faces but I started knowing them 
I think It will be fun and exciting to work with all of them.
I downloaded Wordpress from wordpress.org and copy pasted it in htdocs of my xamp on my local host 
word press was opening and launching ok on localhost but,
I was so confused that whether i need another database or I need to create new one or old one will be ok I am not sure with anything 
but Still I took risk and created new database while installing wordpress.
I started working on my start up website only and I used same images and content I used for joomla as I am building these 2 websites for my assignment one 
for my start up business CK Closet couture. 
Later on I found out that I do not need local host I need this website to be live, like I need to host this website and show all to lecturer. 
this practical was easy but now hosting is a challange for me.
Resources I used :-

Estimated Time spent:-
I spend 2 hours 45 minutes not including time spent on downloading and installing 


Content Insights :-
I found wordpress easy to use then Joomla, it is easy to navigate and work in localhost and start editing straightaway. But now as I used sitegroud before i need to 
check alternative options where I can host my websites. After going through different resources I found out that i will be using microsoft azure. 
I used this before as well I guess I am not eigible for free account but thats ok I will use this only. Now I am not sure how to host my local websites to azure 
do I need to link these or to do what I do not have single Idea

Career/Employability/Learning Insights:-
After completion of this practical I will be able to atleast showcase some basic skills hosting, editing websites and working in dirrent platforms like locally or online
